Installation from UE Marketplace
================================

If you downloaded Dynamixyz Live Link Plugin from the Marketplace, follow these steps to enable it :

#. Open the Unreal Plugins Manager dialog by going into **Edit** -> **Plugins**. |img_install_edit_plugin|

#. The Dynamixyz Plugins category should appear under **Installed** or **Built-in** plugins. Click on it, you should see the Dynamixyz Live Link Plugin. Check the **Enabled** field and restart the Editor. |img_install_select_plugin_engine|

The plugin should now be ready for use.

Installation from sources
=========================

There are two ways to install the Dynamixyz Live Link Plugin from the sources and binaries :

- As a project plugin: the plugin is meant to be used in the **current project only**. It **will not be possible to package** the project with Unreal.

- As an engine plugin: the plugin is installed in the Unreal Engine and can be used in **any project**. **Packaging** with Unreal is possible in this case.

Note that you can easily switch from one mode to another at anytime during your production process.

    .. warning::
        If you have a custom version of Unreal Engine built from sources, the Editor will ask you to compile the sources. If the build is not successfull, please contact us at support@dynamixyz.com.

Prerequisite
------------

- Before installing Dynamixyz Live Link Plugin, you need to create a valid Unreal project.

You must ensure you have the correct version of the plugin for your Unreal Engine version : the suitable version is written in the name of the archive provided by Dynamixyz. For instance, *DxyzLiveLinkPlugin_1.1.1b_UE4.19.zip* indicates that the provided plugin will only be compatible with Unreal Engine 4.19. If you do not have the right plugin version, please contact the Dynamixyz team.

.. note::
    - **PROJECT_PATH** is the path to your UE4 project folder.
    - **ENGINE_PATH** is the path to your UE4 engine folder. (by default: C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Epic Games\\UE_4.XX\\Engine)

Setup as a project plugin
-------------------------

#. Close all running instances of Unreal Editor. 

#. Copy the **DxyzLiveLinkPlugin_UE4.XX_X.X.X** folder under the **PROJECT_PATH\\Plugins** folder.

#. Restart the Unreal Editor.

#. Open the Unreal Plugins Manager dialog by going into **Edit** -> **Plugins**. |img_install_edit_plugin|

#. The Dynamixyz Plugins category should appear under **Project** plugins. Click on it, you should see the Dynamixyz Live Link Plugin. Make sure the **Enabled** checkbox is checked. |img_install_select_plugin|

The Dynamixyz Live Link Plugin is now activated and ready to use.

.. _ssec_SwitchPluginSetup:

Switching from one mode to the other
------------------------------------

#. Delete the existing Dynamixyz Live Link Plugin from the corresponding folder (either in your **PROJECT_PATH** if you are currently using it as a project plugin, or in the **ENGINE_PATH** if you are currently using it as an engine plugin)

#. Delete the following folders from your project: Intermediate, Binaries, Build.

    .. warning::
        This step is important as it will force Unreal to rebuild your project.

#. Open your project: Unreal Editor should ask you to rebuild the project. Accept.

#. Once the project is loaded, check in the Plugins browser (**Edit** -> **Plugins**) that the "Enabled" checkbox is checked for the Dynamixyz Live Link Plugin.
