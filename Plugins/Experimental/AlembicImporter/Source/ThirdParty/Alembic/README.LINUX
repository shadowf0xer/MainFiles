First need to copy ilmbase shared libraries from our Source/ThirdParty code:
/PATH/TO/UE4/Engine/Source/ThirdParty/openexr/Deploy/lib/Linux/StaticRelease/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/*.a

If you need to copy any headers for ilmbase, you'll need to make sure to ifndef on CA_SUPRESS to avoid compile error.

There is also an issue with FBX exposing HDF5/Alembic/IlmBase symbols. So be very careful not to expose any of those symbols
here. From the scripts we have set hidden symbol visibility.
